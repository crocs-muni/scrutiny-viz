CPLC (Card Production Life Cycle) compares manufacturing and personalization metadata reported by the card.

What it is:
- A set of fields defined by GlobalPlatform that describes chip/module vendor IDs, fabrication and packaging dates,
  OS identifiers, serial numbers, and personalization equipment information.

How to interpret results:
- MATCH means all compared CPLC fields are identical (by default this tool compares the first token of each value,
  e.g. "7196" in "7196 (2017-07-15)").
- WARN means some CPLC fields are missing on one side (reference or profiled). This can happen due to measurement or
  parsing differences, but may also indicate a mismatch.
- SUSPICIOUS means at least one CPLC field differs. This strongly suggests the devices are not the same card or differ
  in hardware/software revision.

Important limitation:
- CPLC is static data and can be forged or copied. A perfect match does NOT guarantee the cards are identical.
  However, a mismatch is still a strong indicator of non-identity.

Tip:
- If you see WARN due to missing fields, try repeating the measurement and ensuring the same tool/version and reader
  are used for both captures.
